    "For an overview of various windowing functions, you can explore Window function on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, applying a window involves multiplying the original signal by a window function, $w_k$. One common window function is the cosine window, expressed as:\n",

    "$$w_k = \\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\cos \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n-1} \\right)$$\n",

    "Here, $\\tilde{x}_k$ represents the windowed signal, $k$ is the sample index, and $n$ is the total number of samples.\n",
    "The window function gently tapers the signal at its edges, reducing abrupt changes and mitigating spectral leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Windowing offers numerous benefits, including reduced spectral leakage, improved frequency resolution, and control over side lobe suppression.\n",
    "The choice of a specific window function depends on the requirements of the signal processing task at hand and the characteristics desired in the frequency domain analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example shows a typical plot of a window function.\n",
    "To characterize the window function, it can be Fourier transformed as such, which effectively shows the result of windowing a constant function.\n",
    "The Fourier transform shows a central peak at frequency zero (corresponding to the constant signal), which has a certain width and side lobes due to the fact that the function is truncated.\n",
    "When the `cosine` window by another function from [`scipy.signal.windows`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.windows.html#module-scipy.signal.windows), the shape of the main peak and the side lobes in the spectrum will change."
