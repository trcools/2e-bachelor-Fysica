# Practical sessions

This repository contains the exercises for the practical sessions of the Python for Scientists course. The exercises are divided into two sections: basic exercises and advanced exercises. In weeks 5-10 of the semester, we will focus on the basic exercises. In the last two weeks of the semester, we will focus on the advanced exercises to prepare you for the exam.

It will not be possible to cover all 5 advanced exercises in two classes. The other exercises are there for you to practice. Don't hesitate to contact me (jorden.debolle@ugent.be) if you are stuck or if you have questions. In week 13, there will be a Q&A session where you can also ask questions (your presence is of course not mandatory).

At the end of the semester, the solutions of the basic exercises will be put on GitHub. For the advanced exercises, solutions will not be provided.

## 1) Basic exercises
The [basic exercises](https://github.ugent.be/Py4Sci/practical-sessions/tree/main/basic-exercises) are meant to get you acquainted with the syntax of `scipy` and `numpy`, teach you how to think in the language of scientific computing and give you the necessary skills to tackle more serious problems later on.

However, since the goal is to teach you the basics, it is not recommended to use AI. Try to solve them independetly instead.

## 2) Advanced exercises
The [advanced exercises](https://github.ugent.be/Py4Sci/practical-sessions/tree/main/advanced-exercises) are meant to prepare you for the practical exam.

On the practical exam, you will get two or three problems of a similar difficulty as these exercises.
The practical exam consists of two parts:
- **The coding part**: During this part you will have to write code on your own laptop to solve a few problems (usually rooted in physics). This part is open book and open internet (usage of AI tools is allowed).
- **The insights part**: during this part you will have to answer a few questions (on paper) related to the programming exercises from the previous part. You are not allowed to use your laptop or the course material for this part. The questions will test your insight in the solution of the coding part.

In the advanced exercises notebooks, both parts are combined.
You can use AI tools for coding, but try to answer the insights questions on your own, since this will also be the situation during the exam.
