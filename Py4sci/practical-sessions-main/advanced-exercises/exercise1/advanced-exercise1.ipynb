    "- **The coding part**: During this part you will have to write code on your own laptop to solve a few problems (usually rooted in physics). This part is open book and open internet (usage of AI tools is allowed).\n",
    "- **The insights part**: during this part you will have to answer a few questions (on paper) related to the programming exercises from the previous part. You are not allowed to use your laptop or the course material for this part. The questions will test your insight in the solution of the coding part.\n",
