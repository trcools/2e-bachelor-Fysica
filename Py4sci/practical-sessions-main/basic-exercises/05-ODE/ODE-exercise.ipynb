    "In 1838, the Belgian mathematician Pierre François Verhulst (who was a doctor in number theory from our very own Ghent University) published an equation that he called the [logistic equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function):\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN(t)(K-N(t))\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "This equation can be used to describe the growth of a colony of bacteria or mice for example and is of great importance in the study of population growth in biology. \n",
    "Later, a discrete version of this equation was defined, the [logistic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map), which is very important in chaos theory and the study of non-linear dyamics. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the logistic equation, $N$ represents the number of individuals in a population, $r$ is the intrinsic growth rate and $K$ is the maximal number of individuals the population can reach, for example due to the limiting food supply.\n",
    "The analytical solution to the logistic equation is the logistic function:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "N(t) = N(0)\\frac{K}{N(0)+\\exp{(-rKt)}(K-N(0))}\n",
