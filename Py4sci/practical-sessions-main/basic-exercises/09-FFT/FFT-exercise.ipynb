    "In solid state physics, diffraction of X-rays or electrons is used to study the atomic structure of ordered (crystalline) materials. \n",
    "When X-rays or electrons pass through the lattice of such a material, they are diffracted and produce a diffraction pattern on a detector.\n",
    "This diffraction pattern can be seen as a direct measurement of the Fourier transform of the atomic structure of the material. \n",
    "This information can (after again Fourier transforming it) be used to obtain an atomic model of the material that is being investigated.\n",
