    "PageRank assignes a number to a node in a network (in the case of Google a web page) that gives an idea of the relative importance of that web page. The PageRank of a certain web page is based on the amount of pages that point to it (i.e. provide a link to it). A page that is referenced by a lot of other pages will be an important web page. In this exercise we will explore a little of what is under the hood at Google. Of course, reality is far more complex than what will be explored here, but you should get some idea of what is happening.\n",
