    "Al the CPT's are connectect to each other with the earths __albedo__ and the __CO$_2$__ in the ocean. Earth's albedo is the measure of the proportion of sunlight that is reflected by the planet, and if we have much ice (ice is white and reflects many sunlight) than we can reflect a fraction of the in comming light. But if al the ice is melted then the earth absorbs most of the sunlight and de CO$_2$ emission rises and also the temperature. The ocean kinda works like a buffer to absorb some CO$_2$ but when it can't absorb any more CO$_2$ then the temperature of the earth starts raising much faster because there is a faster growth of C0$_2$ in the air (radiative forcing) (because the ocean doesn't operate as a buffer anymore). There can also be a higher concentration of CO$_2$ trapped in the ice from the ice ages of before. It i melts to that point, all of those gasses are set free which results in positive feedback. The dieback of the amazone results in a raising temperature (also the threes in the amazone hold a lot of CO$_2$ if they get burned, it sets the CO$_2$ free in the air) this results in more ice melting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ice melting in the antartics let the oceanhorizon raise (only the ice in antartica because there is land under it --> only land-ice contributes to that raise). The raise of the ocean level results in more extreme weather states. And like i said earlier is this an example of early warnings, the flickering of the weather changes before it gets to its new state. To get back from that situation to the old sea level is irreversible (or not really, but its not realistic, like you said in class we have to way back from no ice (red arrow on the figure below) to the green arrow on the figure below to see some ice again)."
